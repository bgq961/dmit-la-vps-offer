## What Makes DMIT Stand Out

DMIT launched back in 2018 and quickly built a reputation for delivering quality network routes to China. They're not trying to be everything to everyone - instead, they focus on what matters: reliable connections with premium bandwidth options ranging from 1Gbps to 10Gbps.

Their data centers span Hong Kong, US, and Japan, all equipped with CN2 GIA connectivity. Payment is straightforward too - they accept PayPal, Alipay, and credit cards. No jumping through hoops.

## Current Promotion Details

DMIT restocked two special annual packages in their Los Angeles location. Both come with optimized routes to China, but here's the thing - pick based on your home ISP:

- **China Telecom users**: Go with CN2 GIA
- **China Mobile users**: CMIN2 is your friend
- **China Unicom users**: Either works fine

All servers run KVM virtualization and support Alipay, WeChat Pay, and PayPal.

### Los Angeles CMIN2 Package

| Architecture | CPU | RAM | Storage | Traffic | Price | 
|--------------|-----|-----|---------|---------|-------|
| KVM | 1 Core | 1GB | 20GB | 1.5TB/1Gbps | $49.9/year |

**Test IPs:**
- CN2 GIA: 154.17.2.10
- CMIN2: 154.17.226.2

If you're tired of dealing with congested international routes and unreliable connections, these DMIT packages might solve your headache. The CMIN2 route works particularly well for China Mobile users, while CN2 GIA remains the gold standard for Telecom bandwidth.

## A Few Things Worth Knowing

Stock is limited on these promotional packages. Once they're gone, you'll need to wait for the next restock. The good news? Renewal pricing stays the same - no surprise price jumps after year one.

Both CN2 GIA and CMIN2 packages come with IPv4 and IPv6 support. Some plans even let you swap your IP address every 15 days if needed. The combination of high bandwidth and low latency makes these particularly useful for anyone running services that need consistent China-US connectivity.

The $49.9/year CMIN2 package gives you 1.5TB monthly traffic on a 1Gbps port. That's plenty for most use cases - personal websites, development servers, or light proxy work. The 20GB SSD storage keeps things snappy, though you'll want to manage your disk usage if you're planning heavy data operations.

Network performance matters more than raw specs for these servers. DMIT's partnerships with premium carriers mean your packets take better routes than budget providers. You're paying for the path your data travels, not just the destination.

## Worth Your Time?

If you need reliable US hosting with optimized China routes, this is one of the better deals available right now. The annual pricing makes it easy to commit without worrying about monthly renewals. Whether you're running a small blog, testing applications, or need a stable proxy endpoint, DMIT's infrastructure handles the basics well.

For those working with international teams or managing cross-border projects, having a server that doesn't randomly slow down during peak hours is worth the modest annual cost. DMIT focuses on network quality over rock-bottom pricing - sometimes that's exactly what you need.
